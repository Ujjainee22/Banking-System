Calculator Application using Java 

This project is a feature-rich calculator developed in Java that supports both basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and advanced functions, including square root calculation, exponentiation, and memory storage. The calculator was built using Event-Driven Programming and incorporates Exception Handling to ensure robust error management. This project showcases key programming skills such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), mathematical algorithm implementation, and efficient error handling.
